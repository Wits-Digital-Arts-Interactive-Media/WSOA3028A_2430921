        <h2><u>Goal Alignment:</u></h2>
        <p>
            I want a website capable of showing off my different skills, from programming to photography. I want this to be done through interative and intuitive design of a webpage,
            as well as having my works on my portfolio page. This website will be something I can show to possible employers for any field that I would apply to.
        </p>

        <h3>Inspirations</h3>
        <p>
            I took inspiration from two websites, Keita Yamada gave me the idea to have a live video behind my main page, as a way to immediately my users grab attention

        <p>
            From Sean Halpin, I wanted to emulate their sticky menu bar, that followed with the page, yet remained elusive and minimalistic

        <h2><u>Goal and Aesthetic</u></h2>
        <p>
            To create a minimalistic and enticing website to inspire users to be interested in my work and lead to opportunities.
        </p>
        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <h3><u>Font and Font Colour</u></h3>
        <p>
            In terms of fonts, I have two in mind. For page headings, I want to use Silent Lips, its a very stylized font that is unique but readable for short texts and for the rest of my text I want to use Krylon, I think it blends minimilism with the style of Times New Roman.
            I will utilise white for my text, as it is readable against the black background. If the white contrasts too much, I might settle for an off-white grey. For my hyperlinks I am going to use gold, specifically #b8860b, as it works well on the black background, due to not being hard to read but also striking enough to catch the eye.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Colour Scheme</u></h3>
        <p>
            The main colour scheme of my website is going to be black and white. I want the websites overall design to be minimalistic and very contrasted. The idea is to use this to point towards different parts of the page, especially things like my games, videos and pictures.
            The vibrant colours will contrast greatly against the background.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Alignment and Composition</u></h3>
        <p>
            The whole website will be centered, with a focus on symmetrical balance. Most pages will be split straight down the center to achieve this, but some aspects will have symmetry across the diagonals, while still centered. The idea behind this is to complement the photos and short films.
            Blocks of either two or four pictures will be in the portfolio, the pictures will also be placed such that they will balance out the symmetry.
        </p>
