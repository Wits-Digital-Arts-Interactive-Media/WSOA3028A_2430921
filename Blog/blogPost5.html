        <p>
            For what website I want to look into, I only have one in mind. The Kameraz website. The main motivation behind is due to the awfull fotobuzzah page on mobile,
            which has unreadable text. I think this page has some interesting elements to look into, from store pages to stock pages. It might provide a limited variety though, 
            as most of the website is focused on selling stuff.
