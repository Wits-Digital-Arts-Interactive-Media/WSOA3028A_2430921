        The Need for Global Internet Activity suggests that all communities belong on the web as the lack of this results in those not connected falling behind. 
        The internet allows access the greatest database of information, although it also brings plenty of misinformation with it. A big element that is a part of this however, 
        is that being on the internet exposes your culture and struggles, allowing greater understanding and support of it. 
        Communities which are not able to garner these aspects end up isolated, from the greater culture and from global support.
